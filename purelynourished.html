            <h2>Design Thinking Process</h2>
            <p>Design Thinking in UX is a user-centered process that involves empathizing with users, defining their needs, brainstorming solutions, prototyping, and testing. It’s an iterative approach that helps teams create intuitive, effective experiences based on real user insights.</p>

            <h2>Empathize Phase</h2>
            <h3>Qualitative Research</h3>
            <p>For this project, I conducted virtual/in-person interviews of three potential users. During these interviews, I gathered background information on my users and asked them each a series of predetermined questions to get a better understanding of if/how/why they currently use recipes apps and what they like/don’t like about those apps in particular.</p>
       <h4>Interview Questions</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>How do you decide what to cook during the week? Do you plan in advance or wing it?</li>
        <li>How often do you use your phone or computer while cooking? What’s that experience like for you?</li>
        <li>If you could design your perfect recipe app, what would it have to do?</li>
        <li>Do you follow specific diets or cooking styles? How easy is it to find recipes that fit?</li>
        <li>Have you ever given up on a recipe mid-way? What led to that?</li>
        <li>Tell me about a time when a recipe app or website really frustrated you - what happened?</li>
        <li>What challenges do you face when shopping for ingredients after finding a recipe?</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Research Findings</h3>
       <h4>User Behaviors</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Users typically choose recipes based on ingredients they already have at home rather than shopping for new ones.</li>
        <li>They value flexibility and want alternative ingredient suggestions when items are unavailable or uncommon.</li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Pain Points</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Frustration with excessive ads, pop-ups, and long personal stories before accessing the recipe.</li>
        <li>Recipe pages that time out or lock screens during cooking.</li>
        <li>Encountering paywalls after finding an appealing recipe.</li>
       </ul>
       <h4>User Needs & Goals</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Clean, ad-free recipe interfaces with concise instructions.</li>
        <li>Always-on screen mode for cooking sessions.</li>
        <li>Ingredient substitution options built into recipes.</li>
        <li>Personalized recipe recommendations based on preferences and pantry items.</li>
        <li>Clear, high-quality imagery accompanying each recipe.</li>
       </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Define Phase</h2>
            <h3>User Personas</h3>
            <p>By taking the raw data collected from the User Research stage of this project, I developed 3 fictional user personas. Each persona represents a realistic user group who would potentially be utilizing this app.</p>
            <p>I wanted my personas to encompass varying age ranges, kitchen experience and tech savviness. I pulled information recorded directly from the answers to my interview questions to develop the goals/frustrations/ quotes found in each persona. I then used the personal information and a bit of creative flare to create the demographics and bios of my user personas as a way to humanize the characters.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Ideate Phase</h2>
            <h3>Jobs To Be Done</h3>
            <p>Using the information synthesized from the user research conducted and keeping my user personas in mind, I wrote an extensive JTBD list. I refined my list by developing two categories: wants/needs, then organized the JTBD accordingly. All jobs that were determined to be “needs” meant that they were crucial to my users and had to be included in the MVP.</p>

            <h3>User Flow</h3>
            <p>Using the 3 JTBDs determined as “needs” I turned each into a user flow. I then merged these separate flows together and added any additional screens I thought might be necessary for the following wireframe/ prototype stages. Each task begins at the Log In screen, moves to the Home Screen, has users select the meal type they’re searching for, has them set their search parameters and then branches off from there.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Design Phase</h2>
            <h3>Exploratory Sketching</h3>
            <p>The User Flow of each JTBD was then transformed into low-fidelity wireframes, using the Crazy 8s method of exploratory sketching. During my research stage, I learned that imagery, simplicity in design, filtering opportunities and suggested recipes were important to my users so those were all features I focused in on.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Test Phase</h2>
            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>For the Usability Testing phase of this project, I had three potential users test out my design, to do this I digitized my exploratory sketches and transformed them into an interactive prototype. I used both in-person and virtual methods to direct my users through 3 tasks so I could see how they navigated the design. I made observations and gathered feedback in order to make necessary changes for the improvement of the design.</p>
            <p>In order to get the most out of the Usability Testing, I decided to go back into my sketches and add in a bit more detail prior to showing the prototype to my users. I realized I was missing certain navigational features and wanted to convey clearer designs by adding in certain headers/labels where I thought necessary.</p>

        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <p>I initially aimed for a simple, intuitive design that would get users straight to their recipes, but user testing revealed the opposite. By offering multiple filtering paths, I had unintentionally created too many landing pages, forcing extra steps before reaching a recipe. Users found this frustrating, so I streamlined the process: the Home Screen now features a single filter button next to the search bar, opening an overlay with all filtering options in one place. Once applied, users are taken directly to their results.</p>
