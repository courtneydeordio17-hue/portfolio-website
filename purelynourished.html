          <h2>Design Thinking Process</h2>
          <p>
            Design Thinking in UX is a user-centered process that involves
            empathizing with users, defining their needs, brainstorming
            solutions, prototyping, and testing. It’s an iterative approach that
            helps teams create intuitive, effective experiences based on real
            user insights.

          <h2>Empathize Phase</h2>
          <h3>Qualitative Research</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, I conducted virtual/in-person interviews of three
            potential users. During these interviews, I gathered background
            information on my users and asked them each a series of
            predetermined questions to get a better understanding of if/how/why
            they currently use recipes apps and what they like/don’t like about
            those apps in particular.
          </p>
          <h4>Interview Questions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How do you decide what to cook during the week? Do you plan in
              advance or wing it?
            </li>
            <li>
              How often do you use your phone or computer while cooking? What’s
              that experience like for you?
            </li>
            <li>
              If you could design your perfect recipe app, what would it have to
              do?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you follow specific diets or cooking styles? How easy is it to
              find recipes that fit?
            </li>
            <li>
              Have you ever given up on a recipe mid-way? What led to that?
            </li>
            <li>
              Tell me about a time when a recipe app or website really
              frustrated you - what happened?
            </li>
            <li>
              What challenges do you face when shopping for ingredients after
              finding a recipe?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Research Findings</h3>
          <h4>User Behaviors</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users typically choose recipes based on ingredients they already
              have at home rather than shopping for new ones.
            </li>
            <li>
              They value flexibility and want alternative ingredient suggestions
              when items are unavailable or uncommon.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Pain Points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Frustration with excessive ads, pop-ups, and long personal stories
              before accessing the recipe.
            </li>
            <li>Recipe pages that time out or lock screens during cooking.</li>
            <li>Encountering paywalls after finding an appealing recipe.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>User Needs & Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean, ad-free recipe interfaces with concise instructions.</li>
            <li>Always-on screen mode for cooking sessions.</li>
            <li>Ingredient substitution options built into recipes.</li>
            <li>
              Personalized recipe recommendations based on preferences and
              pantry items.
            </li>
            <li>Clear, high-quality imagery accompanying each recipe.</li>

          <h2>Define Phase</h2>
          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>
            By taking the raw data collected from the User Research stage of
            this project, I developed 3 fictional user personas. Each persona
            represents a realistic user group who would potentially be utilizing
            this app.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted my personas to encompass varying age ranges, kitchen
            experience and tech savviness. I pulled information recorded
            directly from the answers to my interview questions to develop the
            goals/frustrations/ quotes found in each persona. I then used the
            personal information and a bit of creative flare to create the
            demographics and bios of my user personas as a way to humanize the
            characters.

          <h2>Ideate Phase</h2>
          <h3>Jobs To Be Done</h3>
          <p>
            Using the information synthesized from the user research conducted
            and keeping my user personas in mind, I wrote an extensive JTBD
            list. I refined my list by developing two categories: wants/needs,
            then organized the JTBD accordingly. All jobs that were determined
            to be “needs” meant that they were crucial to my users and had to be
            included in the MVP.
          </p>
          <picture

            <img src="img/purelynourished/jtbdlg2x.png" alt="Jobs to Be Done"/>
          </picture>
          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            Using the 3 JTBDs determined as “needs” I turned each into a user
            flow. I then merged these separate flows together and added any
            additional screens I thought might be necessary for the following
            wireframe/ prototype stages. Each task begins at the Log In screen,
            moves to the Home Screen, has users select the meal type they’re
            searching for, has them set their search parameters and then
            branches off from there.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Design Phase</h2>
          <h3>Exploratory Sketching</h3>
          <p>
            The User Flow of each JTBD was then transformed into low-fidelity
            wireframes, using the Crazy 8s method of exploratory sketching.
            During my research stage, I learned that imagery, simplicity in
            design, filtering opportunities and suggested recipes were important
            to my users so those were all features I focused in on.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Test Phase</h2>
          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>
            For the Usability Testing phase of this project, I had three
            potential users test out my design, to do this I digitized my
            exploratory sketches and transformed them into an interactive
            prototype. I used both in-person and virtual methods to direct my
            users through 3 tasks so I could see how they navigated the design.
            I made observations and gathered feedback in order to make necessary
            changes for the improvement of the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to get the most out of the Usability Testing, I decided to
            go back into my sketches and add in a bit more detail prior to
            showing the prototype to my users. I realized I was missing certain
            navigational features and wanted to convey clearer designs by adding
            in certain headers/labels where I thought necessary.

          <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            I initially aimed for a simple, intuitive design that would get
            users straight to their recipes, but user testing revealed the
            opposite. By offering multiple filtering paths, I had
            unintentionally created too many landing pages, forcing extra steps
            before reaching a recipe. Users found this frustrating, so I
            streamlined the process: the Home Screen now features a single
            filter button next to the search bar, opening an overlay with all
            filtering options in one place. Once applied, users are taken
            directly to their results.
